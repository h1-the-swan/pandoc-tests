# Introduction

In thinking about the world of formalized human knowledge, the scholarly publication can be thought of as a fundamental unit representing an idea. Understanding the state of these publications and the way they fit together can provide insight into human knowledge in general. With an estimated 7-9 million researchers publishing 2.5 million articles each year [@ware_stm_2015], the need becomes apparent for some sort of aggregate analysis to help make sense of it.

Citations between these publications provide context to the interrelatedness of the ideas. While not a perfect measure, a researcher's decision to cite another publication usually represents a judgment about the relevance and quality of the work being cited. Conceiving of scientific literature as a _network_, with vertices representing publications, journals, researchers, or organizations, and edges representing citations between the publications, is one powerful way of leveraging this information to learn things about science as a whole.

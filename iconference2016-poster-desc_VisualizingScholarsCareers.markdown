# Visualizing Scholars' Careers Using Citation Networks and Interviews

The question of how best to assess the impact of scholarship is a wide area of research with many possibilities. This poster presents work and future directions in combining methods to create a narrative visualization that presents a compelling view of a researcher's career while also providing the opportunity to gain new insights and ask new questions about the data being presented. The methodology combines quantitative techniques such as citation network analysis and bibliometrics with qualitative data including transcripts and audio from interviews with the scholars. The primary audiences for this work are the scholars themselves, and the organizations that fund research and have an interest in evaluating its impact.

Any organization that provides funding for scholarly research is continually faced with the question of how best to evaluate the impact that the funding has had. These organizations---including nonprofits and government agencies such as the National Institute of Health---collectively spend billions of dollars each year to fund research, and have a strong interest in making sure that their spending is having an impact. A variety of approaches to this problem have been used, some employing methods from the fields of scientometrics and bibliometrics, which seek to apply statistical techniques to better understand things like the history and development of scientific knowledge and the impact of ideas [@de_solla_price_editorial_1978]. One powerful technique that has been used in this space involves the conception of scientific literature as a _network,_ with vertices representing publications, journals, researchers, or organizations, and edges representing citations between the publications [@de_solla_price_networks_1965]. This takes into account the crucial ideas of information flow and the interdependence of ideas.

One challenge that arises in representing scholarship in this way is how to make a meaningful visual representation of these relationships. One typical approach is a node-link diagram, which visualizes entities such as papers, authors, or organizations as nodes, and citations as links or lines between them. While these diagrams do have their purpose, they tend to be too abstract and overwhelming in their complexity when presented to the average viewer. Our approach shows a node-link diagram with one scholar at the center, but builds the citation network out over the course of the scholar's career, allowing the viewer a sense of the developing complexity. It displays this information along with other key indicators and milestones. It can then incorporate qualitative data such as interviews to add extra richness to the narrative.
